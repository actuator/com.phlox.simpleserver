# Application Details
- **App Name:** 'Simple HTTP Server PLUS' `com.phlox.simpleserver.plus` Version: 1.8  &
- 'Simple HTTP Server' `com.phlox.simpleserver` Version: 1.8.1-plus
- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phlox.simpleserver.plus
  
## Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

### Description
The `com.phlox.simpleserver` application contains a hardcoded AES encryption key, presenting a significant security vulnerability. An attacker with access to the application's source code or binary can extract this key, rendering the encryption mechanism ineffective.

### Code Reference
```java
SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec("aKySWb2jjrr4dzkYXczKRt7K".getBytes(), "AES");
```

### Potential Risks
1. **Data Compromise:** An attacker can easily decrypt any encrypted data using this key.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Knowledge of the encryption key allows an attacker to intercept and potentially modify data during transmission.
3. **Loss of Confidentiality:** Encrypted data, whether stored or in transit, can be decrypted if the key is known.

### CWE Reference
This vulnerability can be related to [CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html).

An attacker with physical access to the device could perform a data backup, gathering login credentials and other sensitive information. This data may be subsequently used for credential-stuffing attacks. Key points to consider:

- **Backup and Decryption:** The app's backup functionality may facilitate the extraction and decryption of sensitive data.
- **Credential Stuffing Risk:** Extracted login credentials may be misused for unauthorized access to other services.
