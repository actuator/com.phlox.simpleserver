### Application Details:
- **App Name:** `com.phlox.simpleserver`
- **Version:** `1.8`

---

### Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

### Description:

The `com.phlox.simpleserver` application contains a hardcoded AES encryption key. This hardcoded cryptographic key introduces a significant security vulnerability, as an attacker with access to the application's source code or binary can extract this key, rendering the encryption mechanism ineffective.

### Code Reference:
```java
SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec("aKySWb2jjrr4dzkYXczKRt7K".getBytes(), "AES");
```

### Potential Risks:

1. **Data Compromise**: An attacker can easily decrypt any encrypted data that uses this key.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: An attacker, having knowledge of the encryption key, can intercept and possibly modify data during transmission.
3. **Loss of Confidentiality**: Encrypted data, either stored or in transit, can be decrypted if the key is known.

### CWE Reference:
This vulnerability can be related to [CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html).
